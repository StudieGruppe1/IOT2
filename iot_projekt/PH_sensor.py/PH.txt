Note that in the Python version,
we use the 'analogio' module
to read the analog input instead of analogRead.
We also use the 'mean' function from the statistics module
to calculate the average of the pH array.
Additionally, we use the board module to define the pins used by the Arduino board.
Finally, we use the time module to measure time intervals instead of millis().


The board and analogio modules are part of the Adafruit CircuitPython library,
which needs to be installed on your microcontroller board to use these modules.
If you are running this code on a microcontroller board that does not have CircuitPython installed,
then you will get an error when trying to import these modules.

If you are using a different microcontroller board,
you might need to use different libraries to interact with the hardware.
Please consult the documentation of your board to find out which libraries you should use for hardware access.
